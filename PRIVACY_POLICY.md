# Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2026-02-28

## Overview

Spendly is a personal finance app for tracking income and expenses.
We designed Spendly to work primarily with local storage on your device.

## Data We Collect

We do **not** collect personal data on our servers.

The app stores the following data **locally on your device**:

- Transactions (amount, category, date, description)
- Categories and recurring/frequently transaction templates
- App settings (for example, selected currency)
- Local backup database files you export

## How Data Is Used

Your data is used only to provide app features, such as:

- Dashboard summaries
- Reports (calendar and pie chart)
- Search and filters
- Export/import backup
- Reminder dialogs for frequently transactions

## Data Sharing

We do **not** sell, share, or transmit your personal financial data to third parties.

The app can open external apps/services only when you explicitly choose to:

- Open support links (for example, Saweria)
- Share/upload backup files through the system share sheet (for example, Google Drive)
- Pick backup files from external storage/cloud providers

## Backups and External Services

If you export/share backups to cloud storage (for example, Google Drive), those files are managed by the provider you choose and are subject to that provider's privacy policy and security settings.

## Permissions

Spendly may request limited file/storage access to:

- Export backup database files
- Import backup database files

Permissions are used only for these actions and only when initiated by you.

## Data Retention and Deletion

All app data remains on your device until you:

- Delete data via in-app reset features
- Uninstall the app
- Overwrite data through import

## Children's Privacy

Spendly is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children.

## Security

We use platform-provided storage mechanisms and app sandboxing. However, no method of local or cloud storage is 100% secure.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. Updates will be reflected by changing the "Last updated" date above.
